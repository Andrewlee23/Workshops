# Practice Problem 2: User Login System
## Setup:
Right-click on your `problem-2/index.html` file in VSCode and select **Open with Live Server**. Write your program in `main.js`.

## Instructions
Refer to the [JavaScript Cheat Sheet](../../cheatSheet.js) for reminders on certain concepts.

1. Create an object _user_ with the following properties: username (string), password (string), and isLoggedIn (boolean).
2. Write a function login(username, password) that checks if the inputted username and password match the user object. If they match, set isLoggedIn to true and print "Login successful!". If they donâ€™t match, print "Invalid username or password!".
3. Write a function logout() that sets isLoggedIn to false and prints "Logged out!".
4. Write a function checkLoginStatus() that prints whether the user is logged in or logged out using the isLoggedIn property.
5. Call these functions at the bottom of your file to check them out!
