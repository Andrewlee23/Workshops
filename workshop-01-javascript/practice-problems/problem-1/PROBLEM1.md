# Practice Problem 1: Shopping List Manager
## Setup:
Right-click on your `problem-1/index.html` file in VSCode and select **Open with Live Server**. Write your program in `main.js`.

## Instructions
Refer to the [JavaScript Cheat Sheet](../../cheatSheet.js) for reminders on certain concepts.

1. Declare a variable shoppingList and initialize it as an empty array.
2. Write a function addItem(item) that takes a string (item) and adds it to the shoppingList array.
3. Write a function removeItem(item) that removes the given item from the shoppingList (if it exists).
4. Write a function printList() that prints out each item in the shopping list using a loop. If the list is empty, print "Your shopping list is empty!".
Bonus: Use conditional statements inside addItem and removeItem to prevent duplicate items and handle cases where an item doesnâ€™t exist in the list.
Bonus: Refactor the functions to use arrow functions.
