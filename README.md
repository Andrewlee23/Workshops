### How to Use This Repository

1. **Fork this repository**:  
   At the top right of this page, click the **Fork** button. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account, where you can work on your own version of the project without affecting the original.

2. **Clone your forked repository to your local machine**:
   After forking, you'll need to copy (or **clone**) the repository to your computer so you can work on it locally.
   
   Here’s how to do it:
   - Go to your **GitHub account** and navigate to your forked repository.
   - Click the green **Code** button, and then copy the URL (it will look like `https://github.com/your-username/Workshops.git`).
   - Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer, and run the following command (replacing `your-username` with your GitHub username):
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/Workshops.git
     ```
   - This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

3. **Navigate into the folder of the workshop you're currently working on**:
   Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the directory of the specific workshop you want to work on using the `cd` (change directory) command:
   ```bash
   cd Workshops/workshop-01-javascript
   ```
   Repeat this for other workshops as you progress through them.

4. **Open the files in a code editor**:
